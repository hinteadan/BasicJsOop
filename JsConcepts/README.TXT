The purpose of this solution is to provide a head-to-head comparision between JS and C# app development.

What it covers are the basics:
 - Basic app architecturing.
 - OOP in JS (Class modelling, encpasulation, composition, etc.).
 - JS delegation, event simulation.
 - Other JS fun stuff.


To achieve these ideas we will create a simple CRUD app that manages contacts.
Requirements:
 - Create and app that is able to:
   - Create a new contact Entry.
   - Edit an existing contact.
   - Remove an existing contact.
   - Link similar contacts together.
 - View contacts
   - Ability to filter/search
   - Ability to Sort
   - Ability to Group per letter
